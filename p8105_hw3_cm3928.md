## A brief description of the dataset

The instacart dataset is comprised of **15** variables and **1384617**
observations.

\*\* I am going to group\_by and summarize character variables.

``` r
doyou = 
  instacart %>% 
  group_by(product_name, department) %>% 
  summarise(n = n())
view(doyou)
```

**How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
from?**

``` r
num_aisle = 
  instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  summarise(n = n())
num_aisle
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##       n
    ##   <int>
    ## 1   134

There are 134 aisles

``` r
items_ord = 
  instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle, add_to_cart_order) %>% 
  summarize(n = n())
```

``` r
tab = 
  items_ord %>% 
  count() %>% 
  arrange(-n)
```

``` r
kable(tab, markdown)
```

**Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.**
